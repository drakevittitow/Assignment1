All About Myself
</h1>
<p>
My name is Drake Vittitow and I am from Blanchard, Oklahoma. I am a junior attending Southwestern College. I was formally a part of Southern Nazarene University in Bethany, Oklahoma. Besides being a student, I also play basketball for the college as well as contributing articles and reviews for the Collegian, the school newspaper.

One of my main hobbies is collecting pop culture figures called Funko Pops. They fetch a pretty good price on the third-party marketplace, so I usually buy and resell them for profit. I do this with the help of my little brother and my dad. I also have a passion for movies and music. My favorite genre of music is hard rock and heavy metal. My favorite band is Iron Maiden. My favorite movie director is Quentin Tarantino and my top 3 favorite movies are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Inglorious Basterds, and The Dark Knight.

I am majoring in communication. When I graduate, I plan to become either a radio personality or a sports broadcaster/writer. In particular, I want to work for the Oklahoma City Thunder or on a rock radio station in Los Angeles. Whichever path gives me a job first, then thatâ€™s the path I will take.
