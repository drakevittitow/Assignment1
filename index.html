            <p>
                Content should be organized with &lt;div&gt;'s and &lt;p&gt;'s.  
            </p>
            
            <a href="bio">
                <br>
                It should link to a bio page using a relative link.  
            </a>
    
            <a href="./contact/">
                <br>
                It should also have a link to a contact page.  
            </a>

            <p>
                NOTE: the bottom link was written with a prefixed with './' and postfixed with '/'; neither of those changes made any difference.
